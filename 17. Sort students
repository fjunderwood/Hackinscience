# Part 1:

def sort_by_mark(my_class):
	
	return sorted(my_class, key=lambda i: i[0], reverse = True)


# Part 2: 

def sort_by_name(my_class):

	return sorted(my_class, key = lambda i: i[1])
	


# As an introduction to sorting lists in Python you'll have to implement two functions.

# In this exercise we represent students as a pair of (mark, full_name), so a tuple of two elements.

# Part 1:
# Write a function named sort_by_mark that take as argument a list of students and returns a copy of it sorted by mark in descending order.

# Part 2:
# Write a function named sort_by_name that take as argument a list of students and returns a copy of it sorted by name in ascending order.
