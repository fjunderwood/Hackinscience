def dist(points):
    
    return max(points) - min(points)



# Find the distance between the two furthest apart values in a list.

# Create a dist function, receiving a list of numbers (integers or floating points), and returning the bigger distance between any two given values, so typically the distance between the biggest and the smallest.
