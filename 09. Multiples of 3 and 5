# Write a program that finds the sum of all natural numbers below 1000 (< 1000) that are multiples of 3 or 5, and prints it.

# If we list all the natural numbers below 20 (<20) that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18. The sum of these multiples is 78.

# Note that 15 is only counted once.
